# 🚀 Push to GitHub - Instructions

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ All files committed (93 files, 265,038 lines!)
- ✅ .gitignore created
- ✅ Initial commit with detailed message

## 📋 Next Steps - Create GitHub Repository

### Option 1: Using GitHub CLI (gh) - Easiest!

If you have GitHub CLI installed, just run:

```bash
gh repo create 2un-jovanovic-bike-shop --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

This will:
1. Create a new GitHub repository named "2un-jovanovic-bike-shop"
2. Set it as the remote "origin"
3. Push all your code automatically

### Option 2: Using GitHub Website - Manual

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new

2. **Create Repository**:
   - Repository name: `2un-jovanovic-bike-shop` (or any name you prefer)
   - Description: `Professional bike shop website with product catalog, shopping basket, and XML import system`
   - Choose: **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
   - **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

3. **Connect Your Local Repository**:

   After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/2un-jovanovic-bike-shop.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### Option 3: Using SSH (If you have SSH keys set up)

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/2un-jovanovic-bike-shop.git
git push -u origin main
```

## 🔐 Authentication

When pushing, GitHub will ask for authentication:

### If using HTTPS:
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Your **Personal Access Token** (NOT your GitHub password)
  - Get token from: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  - Scopes needed: `repo` (full control of private repositories)

### If using SSH:
- Make sure you have SSH keys set up: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh
